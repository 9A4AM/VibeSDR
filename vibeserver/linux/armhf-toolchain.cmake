# ★★★ armhf CROSS-COMPILE, from the Mac's NATIVE arm64 bookworm container (2026-09-22).
#     Apple Silicon cannot execute AArch32, so an arm/v7 container would be qemu — the emulation
#     that segfaulted amd64 on a different file every run. A cross-compiler is native speed and
#     the build root is still bookworm, so Depends: stays at the glibc 2.36 baseline.
# ★★ armv7l, NOT armv6: CMakeLists keys -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 off this, which is what the Pi 2's own
#    build has always had. Stuart: "as long as it doesnt effect the amazing performance we got out
#    of the Pi2". ARMv6 (Pi Zero W / Pi 1) cannot run a NEON binary and is NOT served by this.

# ★★★ ARM MODE, NOT THUMB-2 — measured on the Pi 2, 2026-09-22. Debian's armhf compiler defaults to
#     Thumb-2; the Raspbian gcc every previous Pi 2 build used defaults to armv6, i.e. ARM mode. Same
#     source, same NEON flags, one listener on 96.6 WFM: native 167% of a core, this toolchain
#     without -marm 181%. The DSP loops are what pay for Thumb's denser encoding.
